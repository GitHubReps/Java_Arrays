# Hello everyone!
### NOTE
To everyone who is studying JAVA and any algorithms/loops/arrays

**Feel free to use this while studying, try not to only copy solution, but to understand it**

I will try to comment as much as I can, so it would be much easier
to understand how everything works.

### **BASICS**

To navigate within an array you have to know it's length.
It's quite easy, let's check this simple example:

`someArray.length`

With this you can easily get array's length.
Take into consideration that first element would be:

`someArray[0]`

So if you have, i.e., an array with numbers from 1 to 10, their index will start from [0]:

`someArray[0] = 1;`

...

`someArray[9] = 10;`

So make sure to add `-1` (when it is necessary), to array.length, to work with index:

`someArray.length - 1`
